{"name":"VLSCI Pipelines","tagline":"","body":"## Goals of the VLSCI GitHub\r\n* To collect together pipelines for bioinformatics (and misc. software tools)\r\n* To promote collaboration and keeping pipelines up to date.\r\n\r\nMore generic and user-friendly pipelines will be starred so that they rise to the top.\r\n\r\n## Pipelines\r\n\r\n### [exome_variant_calling_pipeline-bpipe](https://github.com/vlsci/exome_variant_calling_pipeline-bpipe)\r\nPipeline tool: Bpipe\r\n\r\nDescription: An exome variant calling pipeline using BWA mem and GATK\r\n\r\n### [bpipe-qiime_closed_otus](https://github.com/vlsci/bpipe-qiime_closed_otus)\r\nPipeline tool: Bpipe\r\n\r\nDescription: A pipeline to assign otu's for 16S reads from fastq files\r\n\r\n### [bpipe-trinotate](https://github.com/vlsci/bpipe-trinotate)\r\nPipeline tool: Bpipe\r\n\r\nDescription: A script to run the Trinotate transcriptome annotation pipeline\r\n\r\n## Guidelines for contributing\r\n\r\n### New pipelines\r\n* To contribute a pipeline, create a new repository and add your code. \r\n* The name of your repository should include the framework (generally the pipeline tool) and the purpose of the pipeline.\r\n* We recommend a BSD3 licence, however the choice is up to the creator.\r\n* The person who first submits the pipeline up takes responsibility for it. For example by responding to pull requests.\r\n\r\n### Changes to existing pipelines\r\nIf you would like to contribute to an existing pipeline, fork it, make your changes and then and submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Harriet Dashnow @hdashnow\r\n* Clare Sloggett @claresloggett\r\n* Juan Nunez-Iglesias @jni\r\n* Simon Gladman @Slugger70\r\n* Torsten Seemann @tseemann\r\n* Matthew Wakefield @genomematt\r\n* Ira Cooke @iracooke\r\n* Jessica Chung @jessicachung\r\n* Charlotte Anderson @canderson1","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
