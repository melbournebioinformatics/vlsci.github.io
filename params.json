{"name":"VLSCI Pipelines","tagline":"","body":"### Goals of the VLSCI GitHub\r\nTo collect together pipelines for bioinformatics (and misc. software tools)\r\nTo promote collaboration and keeping pipelines up to date.\r\n\r\nMore generic and user-friendly pipelines will be starred so that they rise to the top.\r\n\r\n### Guidelines for contributing\r\n\r\nNew pipelines:\r\nTo contribute a pipeline, create a new repository and add your code. \r\nThe name of your repository should include the framework (generally the pipeline tool) and the purpose of the pipeline.\r\nWe recommend a BSD3 licence, however the choice is up to the creator.\r\nThe person who first submits the pipeline up takes responsibility for it. For example by responding to pull requests.\r\n\r\nChanges to existing pipelines:\r\nIf you would like to contribute to an existing pipeline, fork it, make your changes and then and submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHarriet Dashnow @hdashnow","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
